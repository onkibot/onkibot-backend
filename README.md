Requirements
---------
* A Linux/GNU based system<sup>1</sup>.
* [Docker] and [Docker Compose].

<sup>1</sup> [Docker Compose] has issues building our project on Windows based systems.

How to install
---------
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open command line in the local repository.
3. Follow the instructions below in this readme.

How to run local development server
---------
The OnkiBOT Backend uses [Docker], which creates the required database, imports the sql schemas and runs the project.

All you need to do is to edit the `.env` file and set these environment variables:
```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=onkibot
DB_NAME=onkibot
DB_USERNAME=onkibot
DB_PASSWORD=onkibot
```
And run the command below in the root directory of the project.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onkibot-backend-dev up -d
```
You can also run the project through your IDE, but you would need to set the same environment variables above in your configuration.
`OnkibotBackendApplication` is the entry point for the project.

#### Development tools ####
OnkiBOT Backend uses [Gradle] with [Spring Boot]Â and we have the following tools for developers:

* [Google Java Style Guide] testing. 
You can verify your code is up to par with the guidelines by executing `./gradlew verifyGoogleJavaFormat`. 
To format your code according to the guidelines you can execute `./gradlew googleJavaFormat`

* We use [JUnit] (through [Gradle]) for our Unit Testing. You can run the tests by executing `./gradlew test`

* In addition to Unit Testing we have added the [JaCoCo Plugin] to generate test and coverage reports. 
You can generate the report by executing `./gradlew jacocoTestReport`

* If you are using the [IntelliJ IDEA] IDE you can generate the project files by running `./gradlew idea`

* If you are using the [Eclipse] IDE you can generate the project files by running `./gradlew eclipse`

How to run the server in production
---------
To run the project in production, you would to the same as for a development environment.

Edit the `.env` file and set these environment variables to **secure** variables:
```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=change_me_to_something_secure
DB_NAME=change_me
DB_USERNAME=change_me
DB_PASSWORD=change_me_to_something_secure
```
And run the command below in the root directory of the project.

**Note** that this step is also different from the development setup (`onkibot-backend-dev != onkibot-backend-prod`).
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p onkibot-backend-prod up -d
```
